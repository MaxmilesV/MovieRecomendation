# ItP course project, summer. 
This is my second project done as a completion of a itroduction on programming course in the first year of my undergraduate degree.
The project is dedicated to creating of an app for analyzing the movies data from csv file.

It requires QT framework and cmake to build.
Was tested for Windows 10, can't guarantee that it will work of MacOS or Linux.

Main folder consists of all files needed to build the app.
Also main folder has data folder, where one can find data sample to test the app.
README.md, LICENSE.md and .gitignore files are in main folder too, but they are not needed to build the app.

How to use the app you can find in report.pdf file.
Source of idea (specification) is in 1708.pdf file.
